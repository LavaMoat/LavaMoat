## analyze reports when package count changes for no good reason

> Snapshot 1

    `␊
    #### \`foo\`␊
    - Added \`1\` new copies of the package. This is not an issue in itself, but make sure you intended that. Maybe can be deduplicated if you get versions to match.␊
    - The new copies seem to be caused by version mismatch in updated dependents that prevented deduplication.␊
    - The set of packages that depend on \`foo\` has not changed.␊

## analyze reports when package count changes because there is a new dependent

    `#### \`other\` a new package has been added.␊
    ␊
    #### \`foo\`␊
    - Added \`1\` new copies of the package. This is not an issue in itself, but make sure you intended that. Maybe can be deduplicated if you get versions to match.␊
    - The new copies are brought by some of the following: ␊
        \`other\`␊
    - The set of packages that depend on \`foo\` has changed.␊

## analyze reports changes in dependency tree

> Snapshot 1

    `␊
    #### \`foo\`␊
    - Dependency tree has changed and the shortest identifier of the \`foo\` is now \`a>foo\`, but there's no new copies of the package.␊

## analyze handles complex nested dependency structures
