### explanation

runs a dependency-using task in a few ways:

- "node" in node directly. beware: may use native modules
- "bify" browserify bundle in node, no protections
- "bify+ses" browserify bundle run in a single SES root realm
- "bify+lavamoat" browserify bundle with lavamoat in node, default lavamoat config
- "bify+lavamoat w/ harden" browserify bundle with lavamoat in node, with hand-tuned config utilizing the `"harden"` `exportsDefense` strategy when possible

the tasks are run with different "n" values, indicating how many times the individual work should be done.

perf is collected, and printed to `stdout` as csv
