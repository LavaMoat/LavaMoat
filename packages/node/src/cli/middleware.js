 * It is too painful to use `yargs`'s types to determine the shape of the
 * expected options, so it needs to be done manually and kept in sync.
 * `entrypoint` is the only property here which is specific to a command; it
 * just so happens that both commands have idential `entrypoint` arguments
 * (positionals). All _other_ properties are defined as global options; if _all_
 * properties were global, this could just live in global middleware.
 *
 * In other words, this is here to avoid the inevitable future bug when a new
 * command is added.
