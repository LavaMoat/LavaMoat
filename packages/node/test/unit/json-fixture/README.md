# test/unit/fixture/json-fixture

This contains test fixtures in either [DirectoryJSON][] or [Compact JSON][] format.

[memfs](https://npm.im/memfs) can load these fixtures as virtual filesystems. They were created by [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs].

## Creating a Fixture

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs] requires Node.js v22.13.0 or newer.
>
> **This documentation assumes `snapshot-fs` @ v5.0.0 or newer.**

To create a fixture, you can use [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs].

Say we have a directory, `project`, with this simple structure:

```text
project
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The convention is to use `index.js` as the entry point, but this may be
> overridden by macros — see the `jsonEntrypoint` option (where available).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> For this example, `project/package.json` was created by `npm init -y`. `project/index.js` contains:
>
> ```js
> module.exports = 'hello world';
> ```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

To create a snapshot of this directory, execute:

```sh
npx snapshot-fs project.json --dir project
```

It should print:

```text
[INFO] Wrote CJSON snapshot of /path/to/project to project.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> [CJSON/Compact JSON][Compact JSON] is the default import/export format for [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs] v5.0.0 and newer; previously it was [DirectoryJSON][].
> It is **not recommended** to use [DirectoryJSON][] for new fixtures since the format cannot represent all relevant filesystem features (e.g., symlinks).

This is a _less-human-readable-than-usual_ JSON subformat (and I'm not going to show it here).

Now that you have a snapshot, you can use it in a test case:

- Test the policy generated by LavaMoat using the [`testPolicyForJSON`][testPolicyForJSON] AVA macro.
- See [`loadJSONFixture`][loadJSONFixture] for other use cases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Commit `project.json`, but not the `project` directory. See the [Modifying a Fixture][] section for why not!

### Fixtures with Binary Data and/or Symlinks

If you need to create a fixture containing binary data (_use case: native modules_) or symlinks (_use case: `node_modules/.bin/*`_) provide the `--binary` flag to [snapshot-fs][]:

```sh
npx snapshot-fs project.json --dir project --binary
```

## Modifying a Fixture

> New in [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs] v3.1.0

How can we make changes to a JSON fixture without the original `project` directory? Changing `project.json` _in-situ_ seems onerous (and near-impossible, if the fixture is in [Compact JSON][] format). Instead, we can:

1. Use the `export` subcommand of [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs] to re-create the `project` directory:

   ```sh
   npx snapshot-fs export project.json --source project --dry-run
   ```

   This will _print a tree_ of what would change; once satisfied, omit `--dry-run` and continue.

2. Make your changes in the `project` directory
3. Use [`snapshot-fs`][snapshot-fs] to replace the existing snapshot:

   ```sh
   npx snapshot-fs project.json --source project
   ```
