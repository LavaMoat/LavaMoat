This package covers the case where the package.json has a "parsers" directive
that indicates ".js" files are parsed as ECMAScript modules.
There is no "type": "module" directive, so other tools like Node.js and the
`-r esm` shim will presume that every module is a CommonJS module.
This allows Compartmap to tollerate packages that need to migrate from
`-r esm`.
