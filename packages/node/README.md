# LavaMoat Node - a runtime for running LavaMoat-protected NodeJS applications

`lavamoat` is a NodeJS runtime where modules are defined in [SES][SesGithub] Compartments. It aims to reduce the risk of malicious code in the app dependency graph, known as "software supply chain attacks".

## LavaMoat Runtime 

LavaMoat differs from the standard node runtime in that it:

1. Uses `lockdown()` from [SES][SesGithub] to prevent tampering with the execution environment.
   Thanks to lockdown, prototype-pollution attacks are neutralized. It's also a prerequisite to code isolation. 
2. Uses SES Compartments to isolate each package's execution.
   Packages don't share references to anything unless explicitly passed in or allowed by policy. Custom `require` and linking implementation is provided for the purpose of loading allowed dependencies.
3. Enforces the app-specified LavaMoat policy.
   The policy specifies what execution environment each package should run with, which means: what global/built-in APIs should it be exposed to, and what other packages can it require/import.

The result is a runtime that should work just as before, but provides some protection against supply chain attacks.

## Install

*Before you use lavamoat runtime protections, make sure you've set up allow-scripts and install dependencies using that setup.*

Use one of:
```
npm i lavamoat
yarn add lavamoat
```

## Usage

### Recommended usage

1. Install 
2. Run your application once with `lavamoat app.js --autopolicy` 
3. Inspect the `./lavamoat/node/policy.json` file it generated
4. Run your application with `lavamoat app.js`
5. If you find you need to change the policy in step 2 or 3 create a `./lavamoat/node/policy-override.json` file and introduce changes there. You can both expand and trim the permissions.

> **Note** 
> You can regenerate the main policy file on updates (and review for unexpected new permissions) while the modifications you needed to make remain in a separate overrides file. It makes reviewing and maintaining both files easier.

                                            string to the existing policy. When
                                            used in conjunction with
                                            --autopolicy, specifies where to
                                            write the policy. Default:
                                            ./lavamoat/node/policy.json

                                            debug policy. Default:
                                            ./lavamoat/node/policy-debug.json

  -a, --writeAutoPolicy, --autopolicy       Generate a "policy.json" and

                                            files. The override policy is for
                                            making manual policy changes and
                                            always takes precedence over the
                                            automatically generated policy.

## More Examples

### Run with Policy in default location

This uses the existing policy and policy-override files to run your app.

```bash
lavamoat index.js
```

Automatically searches for policy files inside `./lavamoat/node/`.

### Policy Override with Relative Path

This uses the override policy specified at `./policies/policy-override.json`.

```
$ lavamoat index.js --override './policies/policy-override.json'
```

## Tips

- Having trouble reading thrown Errors? try running with the `--debugMode` flag. **Warning:** not safe for production runs.

- For more information on the lavamoat policy file, check [Policy file explained](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/docs/policy.md) in documentation.

## Programmatic usage

Programmatic usage is almost identical to the commandline and its arguments.

```js
const { runLava } = require('lavamoat')

runLava({
   entryPath: './app.js',
   // Optional:
   writeAutoPolicy: false,
   writeAutoPolicyDebug: false,
   writeAutoPolicyAndRun: false,
   policyPath: 'path to file',
   policyDebugPath: 'path to file',
   policyOverridePath: 'path to file',
   projectRoot: process.cwd(),
   debugMode: false,
   statsMode: false,
})
```
