# Laverna

> Publish multiple workspaces (that's all)

If you're familiar with [lerna](https://lerna.js.org), **Laverna** does this: `lerna publish from-package`.

If you're unfamiliar with it: **Laverna** publishes all workspaces that haven't yet been published.

## Features

**Laverna** is a thin wrapper around `npm publish` which:

- Invokes `npm publish` for all workspaces _that haven't yet been published_
- Handles new packages (via a flag)
- Ignores private packages
- Requires a confirmation (by default)
- Provides a "dry-run" mode
- Prints all output from `npm publish`, including the output of `npm pack`, to enable review

## Non-Features

Perhaps more importantly, **Laverna**:

- Builds nothing
- Bumps no versions
- Does not write to `package.json`
- Does not interact with `git` (no tags, no commits, no pushes)
- Does not interact with GitHub (no releases)
- Does not cache anything

## Supported Environments

- Node.js v18.13.0+
- `npm` v8.19.3+

## Install

It's recommended to install as a dev dependency:

```shell
npm install @lavamoat/laverna -D
```

## Usage Summary

```plain
laverna [options..]

Publish multiple workspaces (that's all)

Options:

 --dryRun        - Enable dry-run mode
 --root=<path>   - Path to workspace root (default: current working dir)
 --newPkg=<name> - Workspace <name> has never been published (repeatable)
 --yes/-y        - Skip confirmation prompt

## Examples

### Using Release Please or Similar

For a typical release workflow, you might:

1. Bump workspace versions (e.g. via [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action))
2. In your updated working copy's workspace root, run `npm exec laverna` (or `npm exec laverna -- --dry-run` first)
3. Bask in glory

### Publishing a New Package

If you're publishing a package in a new workspace, you might:

1. Set the initial version of the new package (call it `foo`) in its `package.json`.
2. Run `npm exec laverna -- --newPkg=foo` (or `npm exec laverna -- --newPkg=foo --dry-run` first)
3. Profit

### Automating Publishes

You'll need to figure out how to add `--newPkg` to your CI/CD pipeline. Otherwise, use the `--yes` flag when invoking `laverna`.

## API

**Laverna** provides a programmable JavaScript API (for what it's worth).

Refer to the TypeScript definitions for details.

## Notes

[LavaMoat](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat) needed something that did this, but didn't need Lerna for anything else. So, here we are.
