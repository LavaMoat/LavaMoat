This package reexports things to showcase webpack sideEffects optimization. Note that to ensure webpack does apply it, there's a nonstandard field in package.json indicating it. It's possible to trigger it in other ways, but this seemed like the least likely to flake with webpack updates and other conditions

| Trigger | Scope | How It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`"sideEffects": false`** | Package-wide | An explicit promise from the author that the whole package is safe to prune. |
| **ES Module Static Analysis** | File-by-file | Webpack analyzes individual files and removes them if they contain no top-level side effects and their exports are unused. This is the default behavior in production mode. |
| **`/*#__PURE__*/` Annotation** | Single function call | An explicit hint in the code that a specific function call or `new` expression can be removed if its result is unused. |
