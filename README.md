![LavaMoat](./assets/lavamoat-logo.png "Introduction to LavaMoat")

**LavaMoat** is a set of tools for securing JavaScript projects against a category of attacks called **software supply chain attacks.**

This genre of attack occurs when a malicious dependency makes it way into a developer's application. An attacker could use the vulerable dependency to then steal important secrets like credit card numbers, private keys, or personal data.

These attacks have already hit the cryptocurrency ecosystem and present a significant risk for the developers and users of wallets and apps.

In order to help mitigate the risk of such an attack we are building a suite of tools that range from a node-based runtime, to plugins for common app bundlers (eg webpack, browserify), to dependecy analysis and visualization tools.

**The goal of LavaMoat** is to bring added protections to modern JavaScript apps without having to rewrite them from scratch and automate a good first-start security configuration.

### How to secure your app against supplychain attacks

1. disable/whitelist dependency lifecycle scripts (eg. "postinstall") via [@lavamoat/allow-scripts](LavamoatAllowScripts)
2. run your server or build process in [lavamoat-node][LavamoatNode]
3. build your ui with LavaMoat for [Webpack][LavamoatWebpack] or [Browserify][LavamoatBrowserify]

### How LavaMoat works

The LavaMoat runtime reduces the supplychain risk in **three** primary ways:
  1. Prevent modifying JavaScript's primordials (Object, String, Number, Array, ...)
  2. Limit access to the platform API (window, document, XHR, etc) per-package
  3. Prevent packages from corrupting other packages

1 and 2 are provided by [SES][SesGithub] containers. Platform API access is passed in via a LavaMoat configuration file.

3 is achieved by providing a read-only view of the imported module's exports. This read-only view is accomplished via [Cytoplasm][CytoplasmGithub], a membrane implementation.

### SecureEcmaScript (SES)

[SES][SesGithub] is the sandbox used in LavaMoat. See SES's [secure computing guide][SesComputingGuide] to learn more about the risks of untrusted javascript.


### LavaMoat in Node.js

Run your server or app building code with protections via [LavaMoat Node][LavamoatNode]


### LavaMoat in the browser

When using LavaMoat in the browser, you can just use your favorite bundler if there is an available plugin.

App bundles have **two** major components:

1. Runtime (aka kernel / loader / prelude / trusted computing base)
This is the code that initializes and runs the bundle. For example, the implementation of the `require` function.

2. Module sources
This includes the js content of the module sources, and sometimes some config information like module name alaises.

LavaMoat modifies the bundle's runtime to enforce the configured constraints.


### Bundler Plugins:
  - [LavaMoat Webpack][LavamoatWebpack]
  - [LavaMoat Browserify][LavamoatBrowserify]


### Additional tools

In addition to the LavaMoat runtime bundler plugins, there are some tools to help analyze your dependecy graph and configuration.

See [lavamoat-viz][LavamoatViz] for a demo of the tool.
